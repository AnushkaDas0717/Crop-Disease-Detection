# Plant Disease Detection Project

## Overview
The **Plant Disease Detection Project** uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to automatically detect diseases in plants and provide solution for it. This project helps farmers and agricultural researchers identify plant diseases at an early stage, enabling effective intervention and improving crop yield.

## Features
- Detects and provides solution for a variety of common plant diseases from images of leaves.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for disease diagnosis.
- Designed for use in both research and real-world farming scenarios.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework for model training and prediction.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API used with TensorFlow.
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for image processing and augmentation.
- **NumPy, Pandas**: Data handling and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization and model performance evaluation.
- **Streamlit**: A python library used for making the web interface.


## Usage
1. **Input an image** of a plant leaf to the model.
2. The model will process the image and provide a **disease prediction**.
3. The prediction result will display the disease name and associated details (if available).

## Acknowledgments
- **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **OpenCV** for providing the libraries to build and train models.
